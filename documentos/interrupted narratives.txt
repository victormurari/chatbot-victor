Interrupted Narratives
Interrupted Narratives is an experimental virtual reality exhibition that examines the shifting dynamics between contemporary art, digital colonialism, and algorithmic control. Designed as a research laboratory for curatorial practices in virtual environments, this independent, non-funded, and non-commercial project is dedicated entirely to education and critical inquiry.
As digital systems increasingly mediate artistic visibility, Interrupted Narratives reveal the hidden structures that filter and shape expression. We propose a virtual and multisensory experience in which elements of distortion, erasure, and reconstruction invite visitors to navigate a fragmented artistic landscape—one sculpted by data extraction, censorship, and surveillance.
This exhibition is not just a display; it is a provocation. It challenges us to ask: What is made visible and deliberately obscured? Who profits from the digital art ecosystem? Who is watching, and to what end?

Exhibition Statement
Unveiling the Hidden Control Mechanisms Shaping Digital Art in the Age of AI and
Colonialism
Algorithmic colonialism emerges here as an operational structure: automated curation systems
replicate power asymmetries by prioritizing narratives that align with data extraction logics. Distortion
manifests as language, materialized in virtual reality environments where visitors experience the
progressive erosion of artworks under the effect of predictive censorship filters, partial reconstructions
of artistic narratives through intentional rendering gaps, and surveillance layers integrated into the
interface as a disruptive aesthetic element.
The exhibition experience is built upon a play of distortion, erasure, and reconstruction,
guiding visitors through a fragmented landscape shaped by data extraction, censorship, and
surveillance. Through three theoretical axes, the exhibition seeks to destabilize interfaces, revealing
programmed collisions between organic textures and surveillance geometries. Data archaeology
exposes the metabolic traces left by artistic interactions on digital platforms, while absences promote
a pedagogy of the invisible, mapping the intricate relationships between valuation and colonial
behavioral patterns.
More than a space for contemplation, Interrupted Narratives is an invitation to provocation.
How do systems simultaneously erase and hypervalue cultural expressions? Who profits from the
digital art ecosystem? Who is watching, and with what intentions? Curating becomes an act of
institutional hacking, revealing how digital gatekeepers reify colonial aesthetic hierarchies through
algorithmic “recommendations,” how attention economies transform artistic ruptures into calculated
risk products, and how VR immersion protocols reproduce panoptic logics under a new technoutopian guise.
The exhibition operates as a meta-platform, where the very architecture of visualization
reveals itself as a control device. At the end of the journey, visitors are challenged to recombine
censored fragments, becoming co-authors of interrupted narratives— a political act that transcends
the conventional exhibition space.

VIRTUAL REALITY AND THE
EVOLUTION OF CURATORIAL
PRACTICE: CRITICAL
PERSPECTIVES ON DIGITAL
EXHIBITIONS
Introduction
Curatorship, traditionally associated with the activity of collecting, has come to designate a specific
practice in the field of the arts. The term originates from the Latin curare, which refers to care and
responsibility for another’s heritage. Since 1661, "curator" has referred to an individual responsible for the
administration of museums or exhibition spaces. Throughout history, curatorship has evolved in response to
artistic and institutional transformations, becoming a dynamic and multidisciplinary contemporary practice.
For this reason, the relationship between curatorship and virtual reality (VR) has become a growing
focus of academic interest due to the new possibilities brought by digital technologies. Digital curatorship, once
concerned with physical production, now seeks to organize and preserve artistic information in virtual
environments, ensuring its accessibility in an authentic and reliable manner. From this perspective, virtual
reality expands exhibition possibilities, providing immersive and interactive experiences that reshape the way
audiences engage with art. This situation demands new strategies from curators to integrate emerging
technologies and mediate interactions between spectators and artworks.
In light of this scenario, this text investigates the possibilities of curatorship in virtual reality, analyzing
how this technology transforms exhibition spaces and challenges traditional artistic mediation practices. The
methodology adopted is based on a bibliographic review and an analysis of VR exhibitions and curatorial
projects, aiming to understand their potential and challenges. Throughout the text, the impacts of virtual reality
on contemporary curatorship, as well as its implications for curators, artists, and audiences, will be discussed.
The Role of Virtual Reality in Curatorial Practice
As previously mentioned, virtual reality emerges as a medium capable of expanding
possibilities for spatial organization, narrative construction, and sensory immersion, surpassing the
physical and conceptual limitations characteristic of traditional exhibition environments. The transition
of exhibition spaces between the material and digital realms—from physical museums to the
metaverse—has led to profound changes in how cultural artifacts are contextualized, interpreted, and
experienced by diverse audiences worldwide.
The application of virtual reality in curatorial practice manifests across multiple functional
dimensions. First, this technology enables overcoming geographical barriers, allowing remote access
to digital exhibitions that can be explored independently of visitors' locations. Prestigious institutions
like the Louvre and innovative platforms like Google Arts & Culture have developed sophisticated
virtual tours that replicate physical galleries with remarkable fidelity, democratizing access to
collections historically restricted by geographical, economic, and sociopolitical limitations. However,
VR is not limited to reproducing existing spaces; it enables the creation of impossible architectures—
exhibition environments unfeasible in the physical world—that allow collections to be contextualized in
dynamic spatial configurations tailored to thematic, historical, or conceptual parameters.
The epistemological implications of virtual reality in curation raise fundamental questions about
authenticity, materiality, and phenomenological experience. Exhibitions mediated by VR challenge
traditional conservation practices by operating within immateriality. Simultaneously, VR inaugurates
unprecedented forms of interaction, enabling visitors to break away from passive contemplation
characteristic of traditional galleries. Through interactive functionalities, audiences not only observe
but actively participate in meaning-making processes by manipulating virtual objects, exploring
multidimensional environments, and crafting personalized narratives as they navigate virtual exhibition
spaces. Therefore, this interactivity implies a reconfiguration of curatorial relationships, shifting from a
6
unidirectional communication model to a dialogical exchange. In this new model, visitors assume an
even more active role in the exhibition experience at the expense of merely absorbing predefined
interpretations.
Contemporary VR exhibitions often incorporate auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic elements that
complement visual representation, creating immersive experiences that engage multiple perceptual
modalities. This methodology allows for contextualized and comprehensive analysis of cultural
artifacts—particularly those whose significance transcends visual dimensions—by incorporating
specific soundscapes or temporal elements. Institutions such as the Foundation of the Hellenic World
and Ars Electronica Center have pioneered immersive environments where visitors can experience
cultural heritage within recreated historical contexts, promoting new forms of phenomenological
engagement.
The adoption of virtual reality in curatorial practice requires revisiting established institutional
structures and developing new professional competencies. Curators working with VR must navigate
multiple disciplines by combining traditional art history methodologies with principles from digital
design, user experience architecture, and computational literacies. This expanded skill set reflects the
increasingly collaborative nature of digital curation involving technologists, interaction designers, and
digital artists alongside traditional curators. Furthermore, VR challenges conventional institutional
structures through its inherent decentralization; virtual exhibitions operate beyond physical and
administrative boundaries of museums—enabling collaborations across geographically dispersed
institutions while allowing independent curators to develop projects without institutional affiliation.
Critical Perspectives on Virtual Reality in Exhibitions Context
Although the proliferation of virtual reality (VR) technologies in exhibitions has been widely
celebrated in museological and curatorial discourses, a rigorous critical analysis of these
implementations reveals theoretical, practical, and socio-political limitations that demand academic
scrutiny. This critical evaluation does not intend to deny the potential contributions of VR to curatorial
practice but emphasizes the need for complex theoretical frameworks to guide its application,
preserving the essential epistemological and phenomenological foundations of cultural engagement.
The ontological nature of digitally reproduced artifacts constitutes one of the main axes of
questioning in VR-mediated exhibitions. Walter Benjamin's seminal discourse on mechanical
reproduction acquires new relevance in the digital context, as virtual artifacts lack the auratic qualities
he identifies as central to authentic aesthetic experience. The conversion of material objects into
digital simulacra entails significant phenomenological losses—textural details, material imperfections,
and subtle chromatic variations that identify physical artifacts are inevitably reduced, even in the most
sophisticated digital reproductions. The representational gap in question demands profound
investigations into the authenticity of virtual experiences in exhibitions, potentially compromising the
ability of cultural institutions to promote relevant encounters with material heritage. It is urgent,
therefore, to problematize the relationship between virtual reality and authentic experience with
cultural artifacts, investigating whether the former complements or replaces the latter.
At the same time, the technological mediation of aesthetic experience through VR interfaces
introduces problematic distances between spectators and cultural objects. The VR apparatus—
comprising headsets, controllers, and computational hardware—creates an interpretive barrier that
can attenuate immediate immersion in the exhibition space. This distancing contrasts with the
embodied and unmediated experience of physical museums, where visitors interact intuitively with the
architectural environment. Furthermore, the sensory limitations of current technologies—restricted
7
haptic feedback, reduced peripheral vision, and the absence of olfactory stimuli—compromise the
multidimensionality of aesthetic perception. These restrictions reduce the complexity of the exhibition
experience to a predominantly visual or auditory modality, incapable of reproducing the sensory
richness of direct engagement with cultural artifacts.
The supposed democratization of exhibitions in virtual reality, often presented as a mechanism
for expanding cultural access, also requires critical reevaluation under the lens of digital inequalities.
While VR technologies enable the transcendence of geographical barriers, they impose new socioeconomic requirements for cultural participation. In other words, the high cost of VR devices still
renders them inaccessible to broad segments of the population. Moreover, the technological literacies
necessary for navigating virtual environments presuppose educational privileges that are unevenly
distributed. Additionally, the infrastructure required for optimized VR experiences—high-speed
connectivity, advanced computational equipment, and adequate physical space—reflects and may
intensify pre-existing patterns of socio-economic stratification. Therefore, the apparent
democratization promoted by virtual exhibitions can paradoxically reinforce cultural inequalities,
creating new technological barriers that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
Another critical aspect refers to the homogenization of the exhibition experience facilitated by
standardized VR interfaces. While physical exhibition spaces possess architectural and environmental
specificities—spatial configuration, lighting, acoustic properties, and atmospheric elements that
structure cultural interpretation—virtual exhibitions often translate artifacts into generic digital
environments, decontextualizing them from their historical, geographical, and socio-political
frameworks. In light of this, the digital environment can compromise the essential function of curating
works within appropriate interpretive frames, substituting cultural particularity with technological
uniformity that attenuates the depth of historical and artistic engagement.
A fundamental point to be considered concerns the manner in which the emphasis on
spectacularization and interactivity in VR exhibitions raises concerns about the intellectual depth of
digital curatorial models. The technological affordances of VR often prioritize sensory stimuli and
interactive engagement at the expense of critical reflection and substantive cultural analysis. In clearer
terms, the exaggerated "gamification" can shift focus from contemplation to interactive immersion,
transforming cultural artifacts into mere objects of entertainment, which would indeed reduce complex
historical and artistic narratives to superficial experiences. The risk of this trend is transforming digital
curation into a technological spectacle, minimizing its educational role and compromising its ability to
foster critical thinking and cultural literacy.
As mentioned earlier, the immersive historical simulations provided by VR also raise
fundamental ethical questions. The ability of virtual reality to recreate historical events in an immersive
manner requires a careful examination and an appeal to common sense in representations of
collective traumas, the potential for historical reductionism, and the psychological impact of these
experiences on visitors. The immersiveness of simulations can inadvertently trivialize historical
sufferings, converting tragedies into individualized entertainment experiences disconnected from their
due historical context.
The institutional economy of implementing VR in exhibitions also demands attention. The
substantial costs associated with VR development—including hardware acquisition, software
programming, continuous maintenance, and professional training—impose significant financial
pressures on cultural institutions that already operate with limited budgets. These investments can
divert resources from essential curatorial functions—such as collection acquisition, conservation,
academic research, and educational programs—in favor of technological innovations whose long-term
8
sustainability remains uncertain. The rapid obsolescence of digital devices requires continuous
reinvestments to maintain updated technological standards, creating cycles of expenditure that can be
unfeasible for institutions without access to sustainable funding.
Environmental considerations also raise critical questions about the unrestricted adoption of
virtual reality in the curatorial context. The material infrastructure of digital exhibitions (data centers,
computational equipment, transmission networks, and specialized peripherals) entails substantial
environmental impacts, including high energy consumption, resource extraction, and electronic waste
generation. These environmental externalities contrast with the growing institutional commitment to
sustainability, creating tensions between technological innovation and ecological responsibility.
Finally, the cognitive and psychological effects of prolonged exposure to virtual reality constitute
an additional layer of concern. Relatively recent studies suggest potential adverse impacts, such as
perceptual distortions, proprioceptive disorientation, and psychological dissociations associated with
virtual experiences. These implications raise questions about institutional responsibility for the wellbeing of visitors, especially in contexts of prolonged immersion.
Conclusion
Critical analysis of virtual reality in contemporary curatorship highlights the intricate
interrelationships between technological innovation and established museological practices.
Throughout this investigation, various dimensions of curatorial practice have been explored,
encompassing its historical evolution, methodological innovations, epistemological implications, and
critical challenges arising from the incorporation of immersive technologies in exhibition contexts.
From this comprehensive analysis emerge significant reflections on the evolving relationship between
virtual reality and curatorial practice in contemporary cultural institutions.
The historical trajectory of curatorship, which has shifted from functions centered on
preservation to interpretive, educational, and socially engaged practices, provides an essential
framework for understanding the integration of virtual reality into this context. From this perspective,
VR does not constitute a radical rupture but rather the technological materialization of pre-existing
curatorial imperatives, such as the expansion of access, public engagement, and interpretive depth.
The affordances of virtual reality—immersive environments, interactivity, multi-sensory involvement,
and overcoming spatial barriers—not only dialogue with these established goals but also introduce
new methodological possibilities for their realization. Thus, virtual reality can be conceived both as an
extension of curatorial evolution and as a factor in the reconfiguration of its traditional practices.
The epistemological implications of virtual reality in the curatorial context demand a critical
engagement with fundamental questions of museology, such as authenticity, materiality,
representation, and institutional authority. The conversion of material artifacts into digital simulacra
involves processes of mediation that result in epistemological gains and losses. While virtual
reproduction can democratize access to cultural heritage by overcoming geographical barriers, it can
also weaken the auratic dimensions of the aesthetic experience, creating problematic distances
between the viewer and the work. The dialectical tension between accessibility and authenticity,
between democratization and potential decontextualization, constitutes one of the central challenges
of virtual curatorship. Rather than seeking a definitive resolution, curatorial practice can benefit from
9
recognizing these complexities, developing strategies that value both the democratizing potential and
the phenomenological limitations of virtual exhibitions.
The institutional implementation of virtual reality demands a substantial reconfiguration of
curatorial competencies, organizational structures, and established professional practices. The
interdisciplinary nature of digital curatorship requires the integration of technological expertise with
traditional museological knowledge, promoting collaborations that transcend conventional disciplinary
boundaries. In this sense, cultural institutions must adopt new evaluative criteria to measure the
effectiveness of virtual exhibitions, considering not only technological functionality but also user
experience, educational effectiveness, and cultural authenticity. These institutional transformations
reflect broader processes of digital remediation in the cultural sector, in which traditional practices are
preserved, expanded, and reconfigured through technological innovations that reconcile institutional
continuity and methodological renewal.
The critical analysis of the limitations of virtual reality in curatorial contexts reveals ontological,
phenomenological, socio-political, and ethical challenges that require in-depth institutional reflection.
Issues such as digital inequality, experiential homogenization, the primacy of spectacle, historical
reductionism, institutional financial precarity, environmental impacts, and psychological effects
represent substantial counterweights to unrestricted technological enthusiasm. However, these
criticisms do not invalidate the potential contributions of VR to curatorship; on the contrary, they
establish necessary parameters for its responsible implementation, ensuring that technological
innovation is incorporated without compromising the essential functions of cultural institutions.
Through a dialectical engagement with the possibilities and limitations of virtual reality, institutions can
develop more nuanced approaches that leverage its digital potentialities without losing sight of its
inherent constraints.
In conclusion, the incorporation of virtual reality into contemporary curatorial practice does not
represent a universal solution to institutional challenges, nor an existential threat to traditional
museological values. Rather, it is a complex technological means through which historical curatorial
imperatives—such as accessibility, participation, and interpretation—can be simultaneously amplified
and reformulated. The great challenge for cultural institutions lies in developing implementation
strategies that reconcile innovation and criticality, ensuring that technological affordances are explored
without disregarding their limitations and socio-political implications. By adopting a dialectical
approach that recognizes both the possibilities and the constraints of emerging technologies, curators
can navigate with greater sophistication the intersection between innovation and tradition, preserving
the essential functions of cultural institutions while reflexively integrating new digital modalities. This
critical engagement with technological innovation, grounded in an awareness of its complex
epistemological, ethical, and socio-political dimensions, constitutes the most promising path for the
meaningful integration of virtual reality into contemporary curatorial frameworks.

CURATING THE DIGITAL
GAZE: POWER, CONTROL,
AND EXPERIMENTATION IN
Art Ehibition space view 1.
The virtual exhibition "Interrupted Narratives: Art and Control in the Digital Age"
presents itself as a laboratory for curatorial experimentation in the digital environment. Far
from offering definitive answers, the project seeks to challenge emerging questions about
art, technology, and power, problematizing the relationships between the production,
circulation, and consumption of images in the age of artificial intelligence and massive
digitization. In a context where the virtual increasingly intertwines with the physical, this
exhibition is an invitation to critical reflection on the control mechanisms that permeate the
creation and reception of art in the digital realm.
Divided into two exhibition nuclei, the show establishes a reflective and critical
journey on the impact of digital technologies on artistic creation and the control of
contemporary visual discourses. The first nucleus, composed of four conceptual panels,
presents fundamental provocations that permeate the universe of digital art and the
structures of power that traverse it. These panels function as devices for reflection,
suggesting different readings on the intersection between art and technology.
Images Mine: Who Feeds the Machine? – Explores the data economy and the role
of image creators in feeding algorithms. Who are the true authors, and what does it mean to
appropriate someone else's work to train AI models? This panel questions the invisible
exploitation of artists and content creators whose images are collected without explicit
consent to feed artificial intelligence databases. At the same time, it investigates how
authorship is redefined in a scenario where the machine assumes a creative role.
What Cannot Be Seen? – Questions the invisibilities imposed by algorithmic filters,
automated censorship, and structural omissions in databases. How do platforms determine
what can or cannot be visible? How do programming biases affect access to visual
information? This panel proposes a reflection on the limits of representation in the digital
environment and the exclusion mechanisms that operate silently behind technological
interfaces.
Who Profits from Digital Art? – Investigates the market dynamics of digital art, the
use of NFTs, and the exploitation of computational aesthetics in an environment of growing
financialization. How do economic power structures impact the valuation of art in the digital
context? Who truly benefits from the new models of art commercialization? The panel seeks
to problematize the promises and contradictions of the digital art market, observing how
financial speculation redefines the meanings and values of artistic production.
Who Is Watching? – Discusses surveillance and control in the digital space,
reflecting on the impacts of the omnipresence of tracking devices in art and society. In a
world where data and images are constantly monitored, what does it mean to be watched?
How do surveillance mechanisms shape the production and reception of art? This panel
explores the complexities of privacy in the digital environment and its implications for
creative freedom.
The second nucleus brings together objects that move between AI-generated
production and 3D digitization, highlighting the frictions between the physical and the
12
virtual, originality and technical reproducibility. In this space, the works not only illustrate
the themes proposed in the panels but also challenge notions of authorship, materiality, and
curatorship in an immaterial environment. The pieces exhibited here raise questions about
the instability of form and matter in the digital age, where the transience of images contrasts
with the fixity of physical objects.
By blending objects created by artificial intelligence and digitized artifacts, the
nucleus suggests a debate on the artificiality of memory and how technology interferes with
preserving and constructing visual narratives. On the one hand, digitization allows for the
conservation and dissemination of artistic works. Still, on the other, it raises questions about
the authenticity and appropriation of cultural assets in the virtual environment.
As an independent project, "Interrupted Narratives" assumes the implications of this
positioning: while gaining the freedom to explore themes and experimental approaches, it
also bears the burdens of autonomy, without institutional or commercial support. This
condition reinforces its investigative and open character, fostering a continuous debate on
the possibilities and limitations of digital curatorship. The project's independence allows the
exhibition to function as a space for radical experimentation, where traditional exhibition
formats are challenged and redefined for the virtual context.
The exhibition does not seek to provide fixed answers but rather to expand inquiries.
In a context where images are constantly appropriated, reconfigured, and monetized by
automated systems, reflecting on the flows of control in digital art becomes a critical
urgency. "Interrupted Narratives" invites the audience to inhabit this space of questioning,
where each image, each object, and each concept serve as starting points for an ongoing
thought process. Here, curatorship manifests as a critical practice that problematizes and
deconstructs certainties, stimulating new ways of seeing, thinking, and experiencing art in
the digital age.

HISTORICAL ART
OBJECTS
The artwork generated by AI based
on the prompt "African Art" depicts a hypersexualized female figure, raising critical
concerns about the reproduction of colonial
stereotypes and reductive cultural
representations embedded in algorithmic
systems. By emphasizing physical attributes
over historical or cultural depth, the piece
reflects the extractive logic of algorithmic
colonialism, where diverse artistic traditions
are simplified into generic and often
problematic visual tropes. This lack of
contextual specificity erases the richness and
complexity of African art, replacing it with
an exoticized and objectified portrayal that
aligns with historical patterns of exploitation.
Within the exhibition's framework, the
inclusion of this work serves as a critical
intervention, exposing the limitations of AI
in cultural representation and inviting
viewers to interrogate the socio-political
implications of such technologies. By
highlighting how digital systems perpetuate
asymmetries of power and aesthetic
hierarchies, the artwork becomes a tool for
questioning the ethics of algorithmic curation
and its role in shaping narratives about
marginalized cultures.
14
The "Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture,"
generated from a broad prompt, showcases a
stylized female figure within a figure-eight
shape, highlighting the problematic nature of
AI's interpretation and representation of
Indigenous cultures; the AI risks cultural
appropriation as the lack of specificity from
the prompt can lead to a homogenization of
diverse Indigenous identities, potentially
perpetuating harmful stereotypes, stripping
the artwork of its original social, spiritual, or
historical context, and commodifying cultural
elements. The generic use of "Indigenous"
may draw from biased datasets, resulting in
decontextualized symbolism and a superficial
representation, ultimately prompting a
critical curatorial examination of the ethical
considerations of AI in art and the
importance of supporting authentic
Indigenous voices and artistic practices.
Presenting the digitized Zapotec ceramic vessel (Inv.
GB 278) in a virtual exhibition offers both opportunities and
challenges: while digitization allows for preservation,
increased accessibility, and enhanced interpretation
through added context, its isolated display risks
decontextualization, stripping the vessel of its original
narrative, function, and materiality, potentially leading to
cultural fetishization; to mitigate these risks, the
exhibition should provide rich contextual
information, acknowledge the limitations of
digitization, engage with Zapotec voices for
culturally sensitive interpretations, and link to
relevant resources, fostering a more ethical and
meaningful engagement with this cultural artifact.
15
While the inclusion of the digitized Namibian ritual mask (Figure 3) offers a powerful
"interruptive device" to challenge colonial narratives and amplify the cultural significance of the
Ovambo people by facilitating critical reinterpretation and sharing marginalized stories, it also
carries inherent risks of decontextualization, potential for cultural fetishization, and the
unintentional perpetuation of misrepresentations; therefore, the exhibition must balance these
aspects by providing rich ethnographic data, engaging Ovambo voices, and openly acknowledging
the limitations of digital representation to foster an informed and respectful understanding of the
mask beyond its digital form.
